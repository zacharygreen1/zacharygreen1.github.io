<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise good metal building.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
