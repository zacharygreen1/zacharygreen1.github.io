Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational crime avoidance created to prevent both individual and residential or commercial property criminal activity and can be used in place of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will decrease crime and boost arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other nearby locations where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
