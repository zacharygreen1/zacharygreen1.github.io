<p>The Ring Stick Up Camera is available in wired and battery variations, which can be used inside and outdoors. But neither can record continuously, and they both require the Ring Secure plan to record recordings. Likewise, the wired version normally left spaces of approximately 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both also do not have person detection and geofencing, which other cameras utilize to cut down on incorrect signals.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
