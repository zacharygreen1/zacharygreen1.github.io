<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on developed to attend to the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly picked words) makes pre-shared key WPA practically uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any customer in the network that knows the keys can read all the traffic.</p>
<p>For the many part, wireless security equipment is only as visible as you want it to be. Window sensors are easily hid behind curtains or blinds, and door sensing units are so small that they tend to blend into the doorframe. You can conceal a wireless camera much easier than you can one with wires. Wireless is the much better option if you desire home security that mixes into your decor and doesn't draw attention to itself. Wireless systems are also perfect for occupants because they don't need opening the wall, and can quickly be taken with you when you move to your next place. If you're looking to enhance your apartment's security, or just wish to keep an eye on your location while you're out, consider installing a portable wireless security system.</p>
