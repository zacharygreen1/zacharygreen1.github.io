<h2>How Can CCTV Surveillance Systems Improve Security Webster City</h2>
<p>No. Monitored medical alarms are not included in this new law. These alarms vary from panic alarms, which are covered. Panic alarms receive cops response based upon fear of impending injury or physical harm due to criminal activity, while medical alarms normally receive fire reaction based on an emergency situation due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.
