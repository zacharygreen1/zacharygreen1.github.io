The Ring Floodlight Camera integrates 2 essential devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera identifies motion, it switches on its 2 powerful LED beams along with its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording.

A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of spotting small differences in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and creates an electronic image based upon details about the temperature differences. Since objects are hardly ever precisely the exact same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can spot them, and they will look like distinct in a thermal image.</p>
