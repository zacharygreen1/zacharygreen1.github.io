<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
