As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
