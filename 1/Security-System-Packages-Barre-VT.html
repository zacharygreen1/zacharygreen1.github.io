<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment this way to make clients stick with them longer, since switching monitoring companies means hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients. How did they do it? They put 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their most current software and firmware.

This also depends on the provider, however you can expect signing a contract with companies who need professional installation of their systems. The average length of a home security contract is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some agreements might span approximately 60 months or 5 years. We would recommend thinking about a DIY home security system instead if you desire to avoid having to sign an agreement.</p>
