<p>Wireless home security is flexible. If you do not like where a sensor or camera is put, move it. There are no wires stopping you. Add them or take them away easily if you want more or less gadgets on your system. You can install the system yourself or work with an expert. The option is yours. Wired systems require professional installation, and you can't quickly include equipment or move it around. You're tethered by wires. Wireless systems use a flexibility that wired systems can not.</p>
<p>This totally depends on your house. If you have 15 doors and a million windows, then you'll need more sensing units and equipment than somebody who resides in a studio apartment.
