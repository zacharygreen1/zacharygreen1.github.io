But suicide opponents are plainly not prevented by camera - and might even be brought in to the television protection cameras can ensure - and the expense of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far goes beyond the minimal benefits that the system might offer in examining attacks or tried attacks after the reality (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our screening.
