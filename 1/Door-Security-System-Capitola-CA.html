<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control board (normally situated in the entrance hall) that is utilized to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensors have actually been activated, smart alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have been set off, rather than getting home to find your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly irritating your neighbours).
