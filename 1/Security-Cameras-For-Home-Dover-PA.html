<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to solve detail after the reality, which implies that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and use up a great deal of recording storage space. So much, in truth, that they require about four times the hard drive space of 1080p to record the same length of video footage.
