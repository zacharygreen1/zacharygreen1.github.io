Additionally, the shape of the camera is perfect for focusing on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, however requires numerous cameras if a user needs to see several fixed views.

We've also tried to restrict this list to cameras that can serve up signals that are reliable and actually beneficial - if your camera is pinging your phone whenever a leaf blows previous, you're quickly going to get fed up with having to check it.</p>
