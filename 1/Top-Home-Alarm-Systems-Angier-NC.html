That isn't to state that you can't have wired home automation, since you can, however automated equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and more difficult to encrypt.

If someone cuts the phone line, though, you will not be able to use the system to call for assistance.</p>
<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal performance.

For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a fantastic choice for long range circumstances where poles and trees are not present.</p>
