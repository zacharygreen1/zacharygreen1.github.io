<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a great security camera and an incredible value. It receives an Outstanding rating for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video footage in your area on an SD card.
