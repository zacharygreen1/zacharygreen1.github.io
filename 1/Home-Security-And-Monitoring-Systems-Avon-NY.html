<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the entire household will enjoy. ADT is a household name, so we frequently check out their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task. In our newest round of screening, we recognized that ADT is the most popular provider for a factor. We think their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with nifty wise home functions. We specifically liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>

Consider that some companies lock you into their service for a year or more. Breaking the contract might cost you hundreds of dollars. The Arlo Pro is the company's first wireless home security camera, and though it's been eclipsed in features and resolutions by newer designs, the original still holds up well.

Windows smash, dogs howl, felines scream, babies weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>
