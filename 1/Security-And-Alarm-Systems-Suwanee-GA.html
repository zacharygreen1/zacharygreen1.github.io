You won't have to stress about it tape-recording or sending out an alert every time the canine walks by if the camera is pointed towards a high-traffic location.

Watch on what matters by streaming your security camera on your TV using Google Nest or Home speaker or display and Chromecast or a TV with Chromecast built-in.</p>

Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
