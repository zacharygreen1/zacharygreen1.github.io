<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate in between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a regular camera image. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve detail after the truth, which implies that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and use up a great deal of taping storage area. So much, in fact, that they require about 4 times the hard drive space of 1080p to record the same length of video footage. If extended video storage is important, be prepared to spend more cash.</p>
