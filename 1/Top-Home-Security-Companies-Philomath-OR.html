<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
