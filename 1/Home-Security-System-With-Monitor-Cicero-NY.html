The second guard showed up in the middle of the night and took over. When I got here in the early morning to get the occasion began, he was also professional, courteous and reassuring. We were very happy with your service and I will recommend that we contact your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep.
