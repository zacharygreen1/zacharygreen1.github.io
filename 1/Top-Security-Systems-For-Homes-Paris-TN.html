<p>Amongst IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free.

<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community must take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer break-ins across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police ability to apprehend intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and whole communities (all taxpayers fund police reaction to alarmed homes) a inefficient and expensive approach to theft decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
