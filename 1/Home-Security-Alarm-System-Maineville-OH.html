This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

Unfortunately, as soon as clients realize that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
