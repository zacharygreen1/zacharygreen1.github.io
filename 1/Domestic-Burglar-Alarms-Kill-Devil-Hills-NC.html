<h3>Wireless Alarm System Kill Devil Hills NC 27948</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the maker's statistics because this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant culprit for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capacity is a bit restricted to advise as a top pick.</p>
<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a normal camera image. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to fix information after the fact, which suggests that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some advantages, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are very large and use up a lot of tape-recording storage space. So much, in truth, that they need about four times the hard drive area of 1080p to record the very same length of video footage. If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to spend more cash.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
