<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you have actually labeled (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>A compelling argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe membership is that it adds person detection, that makes for smarter smartphone notifies-- and, in some cases, fewer false alerts. You will not have to worry about it recording or sending an alert every time the dog walks by if the camera is pointed towards a high-traffic location. (We think this is a better feature if you're positioning the Circle 2 outside, where cars regularly pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's great that it's not required, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Webcam.</p>
