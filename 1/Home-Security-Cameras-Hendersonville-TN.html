<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment by doing this to make consumers stick with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies means hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for customers. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which device was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
