The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
