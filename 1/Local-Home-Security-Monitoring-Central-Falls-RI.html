So if you currently protect your home with a security system you enjoy, you can most likely get a comparable system for your business (presuming it meets all your business requirements, obviously).</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
