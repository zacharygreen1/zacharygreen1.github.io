<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or home is the responsibility of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you plan to store and the length of time you plan to keep documented video footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to eat up storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage when you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived video that you still need.</p>
<p>The first (and most obvious, for sure) element of a CCTV system are the security cameras. Which security cameras are best for your system depends upon your individual requirements and budget plan; are you putting them indoors or outdoors? Is 1080P a big adequate resolution?
