IP cameras that are linked to the same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR.

There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
