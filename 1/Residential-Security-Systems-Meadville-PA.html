Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
