<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be considered. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal.

The alarm system is simply one of 2 we checked that consists of an external siren, and we're impressed that it also features a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, even more dissuading anyone from attempting to break in to your residential or commercial property.
