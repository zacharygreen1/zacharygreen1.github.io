<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal construction.

Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they do not stick out excessive. Pretty easy to install.
