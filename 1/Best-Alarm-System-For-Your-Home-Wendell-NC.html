<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
