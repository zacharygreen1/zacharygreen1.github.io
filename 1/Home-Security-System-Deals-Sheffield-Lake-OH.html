<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive opponent, considering that the interruption of the network avoids the circulation of data and actually indirectly safeguards information by preventing it from being transferred. The usual factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying an opportunity for the malicious assaulter to tape these codes and utilize various splitting tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can release a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based upon the "model" security key recorded throughout the network healing.</p>
<p>IP (Internet protocol) cameras carry out the same functions as their analog equivalents, however with greatly higher capabilities.

The major downside of IP cameras is their higher cost.</p>
