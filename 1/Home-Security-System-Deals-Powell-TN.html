<p>Three big advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, expandability and mobility. Occupants, unlike homeowners, normally avoid making irreversible changes to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can quickly be established at different properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new elements too.
