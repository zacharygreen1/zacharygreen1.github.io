<p>So, while alarm may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community should carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less burglaries throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to cops capability to apprehend intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers fund police response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and expensive method to theft reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
