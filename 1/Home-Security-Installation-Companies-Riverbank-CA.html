<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, ought to provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on use).

The same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
