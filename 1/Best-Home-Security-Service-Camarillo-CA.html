<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, because it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR.

The innovation slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet budget-friendly systems offered today.
