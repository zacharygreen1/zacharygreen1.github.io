<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complicated than it needs to be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
