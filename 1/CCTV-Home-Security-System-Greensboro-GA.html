<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
