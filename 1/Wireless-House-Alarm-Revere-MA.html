<p>Keypad: A smart device app is a must for use when you're away from home, however you shouldn't need to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it easy to arm and deactivate the system. Adding Ring Alarm makes sense if you currently own a Ring video doorbell and desire to expand your home security protection. When you include other Ring products to Sound Alarm it becomes a more robust security system that can deliver live video streaming, two-way communication, and clever lighting.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
