<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
