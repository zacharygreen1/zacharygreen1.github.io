<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
