<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be handy for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof because it does not have wires that can be cut. Regrettably I acquired 4 cameras that look much like these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is actually fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
