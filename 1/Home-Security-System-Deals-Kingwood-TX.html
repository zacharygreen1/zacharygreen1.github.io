Now, a lot of security systems include a great number of parts, such as a base station, security camera, glass, motion, and entry break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few parts.

"As soon as the criminal offense and offence figures were gotten used to appraise the general down trend in offences and crimes," criminologists discovered in one research study, "reductions were kept in mind in particular categories but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had decreased criminal offense in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the fear of criminal activity (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>
