<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, accommodating advanced smart home fanatics or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I tested, including creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. However the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of emergency alarm or camera backups-- is likewise costly if you do not devote to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to utilize as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a knowing curve.
