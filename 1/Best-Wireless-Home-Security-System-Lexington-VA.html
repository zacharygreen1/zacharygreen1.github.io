<p>Want to add a flood sensor? A clever door lock? Your system can act as a center for approximately 119 wise home gadgets, and can be controlled through Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TV, and more. IP cameras can also be connected to what is referred to as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out information from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a different power source, implying a more intricate setup and more wires. PoE switches are also normally considered as a more secure method to transmit data.</p>
<p>This system utilizes an electro-magnetic field disruption concept based upon 2 unshielded (or 'leaky') coax cables buried roughly 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter produces constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is received by the other cable.

<p>Cloud storage: Tape-recorded video can be kept on the cloud in addition to on your video recorder. There are a few unique benefits to doing this, consisting of having remote access to your videos and exceptional storage volume.
