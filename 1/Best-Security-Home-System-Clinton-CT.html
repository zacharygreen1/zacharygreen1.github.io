The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
