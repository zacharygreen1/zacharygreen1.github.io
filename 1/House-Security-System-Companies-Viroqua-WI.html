Wi-Fi cameras aren't just for catching a burglar in the act, though. They're also beneficial for casual home monitoring. Placed on countertops, racks, and tables, they permit you to keep an eye on what your family pets are doing, understand when the kids come home from school, or find who's been striking the liquor cabinet.

<p>If you reside in a small apartment and want to keep tabs on things when you're not home, a security camera can finish the job for a lot less cash than what you'll spend for a complete security system. Nearly all standalone security cameras link to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensing units that detect motion and noise and will send out push and e-mail notices when those sensing units are triggered. You can usually fine-tune the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to animal activity or passing cars and trucks if the camera is near a window, and you can develop a schedule that turns the sensors on and off throughout certain hours of the day.</p>
