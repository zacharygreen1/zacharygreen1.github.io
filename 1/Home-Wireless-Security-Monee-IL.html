<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
