Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you stroll by.
