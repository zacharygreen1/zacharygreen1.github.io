<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors protect your security system against transient surges that can enter through Air Conditioner power lines, telephone lines and remote notice zones. Home automation is practical and simple, and wireless systems help you automate your home that much easier. Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automatic home devices are by their very nature wireless, and most home security companies offer a home automation bundle with an app to remotely manage everything on the system. That isn't to say that you can't have wired home automation, due to the fact that you can, but automatic equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to secure. It isn't extremely wise. Wireless devices communicate more securely and faster to other devices on the system and to the monitoring center (if you select monitoring).</p>
