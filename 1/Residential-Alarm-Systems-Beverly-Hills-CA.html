<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment in this manner to make consumers stick with them longer, since switching monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for consumers. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their most current software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which device was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>Depending upon the zone activated, number and series of zones, time of day, and other aspects, the alarm monitoring center might instantly start various actions. Central station operators might be advised to call emergency situation services immediately, or to initially call the secured properties or home manager to try to figure out if the alarm is genuine. Operators could also start calling a list of contact number provided by the consumer to call someone to go look at the secured facilities. Some zones might trigger a call to the local heating oil company to go examine the system, or a call to the owner with information of which room may be getting flooded. Some alarm are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be immediately shown on a remote monitor, not to mention tape-recorded.</p>

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the problem. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as definitive, we believe this issue is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the current system.</p>
