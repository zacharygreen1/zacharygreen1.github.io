In addition to functioning as a deterrent, cameras can alert cops of criminal offenses as they happen, which can enable officers to react rapidly and effectively (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal.

The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the current pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or 4 complimentary incorrect alarms per calendar year, since they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
