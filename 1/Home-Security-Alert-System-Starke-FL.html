This chapter governs burglar alarm systems planned to summon cops department personnel, requires registration, evaluation of costs for excessive incorrect alarm system, offers treatments for repeat offenders, and supplies an efficient date.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
