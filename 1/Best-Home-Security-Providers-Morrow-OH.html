However, those features come at a relatively steep price: $5 per month ($50 each year) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.  For each additional camera, the membership is discounted to about half of the preliminary fee. By contrast, Arlo charges $3 per month for individual detection with thirty days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those features and bumps storage approximately 31 days.</p>
<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides totally free benefits like person detection, familiar-face informs, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 monthly.) However, in our tests the familiar-face notifies worked just about half of the time and the camera regularly detached from the network several times a day (when everything else on our network seemed fine). The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and tape-recorded clips, as well as when we made changes in the settings.</p>
