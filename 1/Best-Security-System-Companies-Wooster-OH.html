<p>Some home insurance coverage service providers need you to have an alarm system as part of their policy. However, alarms needed by insurance companies should adhere to the European Requirement EN 50131 and needs to be set up by an NSI or SSAIB accredited installer.

CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense prevention method, which argues that opportunities to offend can be lowered by modifying a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a wrongdoer being collared, increasing the effort to commit the crime, reducing rewards from crime commission, and reducing justifications that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the wrongdoer must be aware of the included surveillance for it to accomplish its desired impact.</p>
