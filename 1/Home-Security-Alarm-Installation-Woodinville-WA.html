<p>Discover how to design, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and lower criminal offense. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensor to be sensitive, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was defective, and so we might revisit this review. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video to the cloud. The broad face of the camera provides you an impressive field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to wait to the cloud.)

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency.
