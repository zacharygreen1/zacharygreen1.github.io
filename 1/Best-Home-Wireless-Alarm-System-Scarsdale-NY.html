<h3>Home Camera Surveillance Scarsdale NY 10583</h3>
<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide easy Do It Yourself installation, other companies use (and often need) professional installation. Expert installation is available for hardwired and wireless home security systems. Bear in mind that cameras with two-way audio normally work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's occurring on the other end. And while this is a pretty basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>You can utilize a wireless connection to operate your SimpliSafe system, but it doesn't support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, suggesting you won't have the ability to link it directly to other third-party devices like wise locks or automate specific actions in the home.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
