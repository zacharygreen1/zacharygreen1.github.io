The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
