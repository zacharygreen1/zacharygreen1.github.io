If you include monitoring, fees will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 each month. If you dedicate to a three-year agreement, the price of the Nest service drops to $19 per month. Ring's Protect Plus plan chooses $10 each month and does not need a contract.</p>
