The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>

Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership).
