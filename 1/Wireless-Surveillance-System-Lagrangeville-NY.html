<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
