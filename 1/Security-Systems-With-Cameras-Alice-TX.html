<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items.

<h3>Home Security Alert System in Texas</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader location and for that reason uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Each mobile phone app comes with various settings, so choose one that fits your needs. Location sensing is very helpful as it can inform when you get home or leave (using your phone's GPS) and turn alarms and camera on or off appropriately. When the cat walk past, all systems allow you to change the sensitivity of the motion detection and it's worth playing with these to prevent getting false alarms. You can likewise adjust some cameras to only look at specific locations - a doorway for example.</p>
