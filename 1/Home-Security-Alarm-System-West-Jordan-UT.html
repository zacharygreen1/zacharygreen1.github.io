<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>

<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a satisfaction to use also (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though. If you don't already have an Arlo camera or 2 in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can indicate there are range concerns.</p>
