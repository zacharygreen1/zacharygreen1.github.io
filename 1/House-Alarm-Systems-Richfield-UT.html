Continue with caution when you're dealing with companies who install proprietary systems and claim that they only deal with their licensed monitoring systems.

<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their portability, impermanence and expandability. Occupants, unlike homeowners, generally prevent making permanent modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and setting up irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can easily be established at various properties later on, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also enable remote control of the system and general home automation.
