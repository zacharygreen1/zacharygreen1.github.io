<p>Because it's more complex than it should be, we don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
