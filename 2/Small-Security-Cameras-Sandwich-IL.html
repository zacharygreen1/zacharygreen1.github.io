<p>Multiple screens were set up within the new command center with a single monitor designated to alarm screens. As soon as any alarm system integrated into the PCU was activated, the closest camera to that area would be shown on that particular monitor. The chance that the repaired camera would be pointed in the direction of the event depends on the initial requirements for area of protection. If there are 3 select emergency exits, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single fixed camera can just view one. This creates a one in three opportunity of catching a specific event on video (either live or tape-recorded). The command center also consisted of a computer system designated for submitting incident reports online. These can be accessed by management personnel at a later date from a database via the computer system network.</p>
