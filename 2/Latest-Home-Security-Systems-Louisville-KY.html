<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
<p>DIY installation is becoming more popular-- not just with SimpliSafe however also with other systems like the Ring alarm. All of Frontpoint's equipment is intended for simple do-it-yourself (Do It Yourself) installation.

A lot of alarm companies make you sign a three-year agreement, however Link provides agreements as short as one year. Or, if mobile control or video monitoring are your priorities, Link is among the least expensive options.</p>
