<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to fix information after the truth, which indicates that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it likewise brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of recording storage area.
