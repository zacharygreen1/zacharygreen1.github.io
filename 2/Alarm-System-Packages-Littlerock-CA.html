<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
