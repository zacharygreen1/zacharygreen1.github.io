<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment this way to make consumers stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies means numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for customers. How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which device was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
