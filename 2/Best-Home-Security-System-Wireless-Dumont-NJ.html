<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is an excellent security camera and an incredible value. It receives an Outstanding ranking for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription prepare for additional cloud storage.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
