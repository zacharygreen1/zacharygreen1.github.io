<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
