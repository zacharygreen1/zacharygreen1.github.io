<p>Bullet cameras are among the 2 most common CCTV camera types. They have a long round shape, giving them their name and a distinct look. This look is identifiable to nearly everyone and therefore acts as a deterrent to unwanted people. The hope is burglars and wrongdoers go elsewhere instead if security cameras are noticeable. That being stated, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism because of their apparent look. Furthermore, the shape of the camera is ideal for concentrating on a set field, such as an entry or exit, but requires several cameras if a user requires to see numerous set views. Bullet cameras are quickly mountable and can work inside your home or outdoors. They include a small lip on the end of the camera that includes weather protection and decreases glare.</p>
<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be thought about. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.
