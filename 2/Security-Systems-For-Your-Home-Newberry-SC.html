<p>Another important topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video photo; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image.

Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
