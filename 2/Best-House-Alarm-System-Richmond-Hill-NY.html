IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
