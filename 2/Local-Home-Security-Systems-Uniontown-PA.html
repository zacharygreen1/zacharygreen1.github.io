<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, accommodating advanced smart home connoisseurs or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I checked, consisting of smart things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. But the Secure is costly, extra sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is likewise expensive if you do not devote to a three-year agreement.</p>
