The innovation gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and watch it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>

<p>Note: The above CCTV camera types just touch the IP camera world and overlook the old analog cameras, given that everybody prefers IP cameras today for their cost effective prices, features and easy setup.

A wired security camera can can be found in 2 kinds, both needing wires to supply power and for the functions of video transmission.
