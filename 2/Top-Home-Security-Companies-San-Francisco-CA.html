The innovation gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and watch it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
