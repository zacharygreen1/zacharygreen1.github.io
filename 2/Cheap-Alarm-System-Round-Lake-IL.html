<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats considering that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest culprit for brief battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit limited to advise as a top choice.</p>
<p>Analog hd cameras are an excellent option for companies to update from analog CCTV that has already been wired utilizing coax cable or CAT-5 cable television. AHD cameras use the exact same RG59 or RG6 cable television as conventional CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable with video baluns can likewise be used. While professional monitoring expenses more, it's more secure. Your monitoring company will get the alert and then alert the authorities for you when something triggers your alarm. Appears like a much safer bet to us.</p>
