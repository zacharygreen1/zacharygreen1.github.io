When it detected any type of interference, SimpliSafe responded with a declaration stating the system would inform users. The company likewise questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of scenarios for somebody to successfully hack the system.

In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a personal guard. A number of cities also require an authorization to even run a home and own security system. Rules such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>
