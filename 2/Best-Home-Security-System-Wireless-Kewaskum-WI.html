If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared essential WPA practically uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
