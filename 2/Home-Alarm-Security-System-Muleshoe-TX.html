<p>A lot of home security systems include DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make certain that that's a simple process. If a home security company only provides expert installation, I observe the procedure and make sure that the price isn't too high. Expert home security installation tends to skew upwards of $100, but it's truly your choice whether or not it's worth its significant price.

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
