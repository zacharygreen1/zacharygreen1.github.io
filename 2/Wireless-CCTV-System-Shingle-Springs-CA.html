<h3>Basic Home Security in California</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and therefore uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
