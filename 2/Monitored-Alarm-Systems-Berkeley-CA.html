Similar to their indoor counterparts, outdoor cameras link to your Wi-Fi network and allow you to view live video from your phone.

<p>Video and image feeds have actually shown invaluable for surveillance - however there's room for more functionality by using audio. People have 5 senses that jointly allow us to accurately range our environment. For that reason, it just makes sense that a security system that engages as many senses as possible is more efficient. And due to the fact that it's not practical to engage smell, taste, and touch remotely, the most reliable video surveillance systems integrate sight and hearing to boost security protection.</p>
<p>GO2's customized wireless network camera systems enable surveillance without the hassle and require for inside and complex wiring. Proxim's wireless services have allowed highly trustworthy video surveillance networks in all corners of the world.

Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I checked, consisting of smart things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. However the Secure is expensive, additional sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also expensive if you do not commit to a three-year contract.</p>
