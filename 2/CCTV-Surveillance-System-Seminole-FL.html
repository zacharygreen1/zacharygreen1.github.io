In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

<p>Another crucial topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much photo details as 1080p.
