<p>We do not conceal equipment costs by rolling them into a high monthly rate. At Smith Thompson Security our company believe the right thing to do is, is to show you the rate of the equipment and monitoring rate separately. That way you REALLY know what you're spending.

The good news is, surveillance doesn't need to be difficult. Keep checking out to see the equipment and components you'll need to get your IP surveillance system up and running.</p>
