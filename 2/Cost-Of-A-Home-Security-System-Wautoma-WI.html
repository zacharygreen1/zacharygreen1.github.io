<p>Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless means the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the web.

Although battery replacements are necessary, these are the simplest alternative to install and all of the taped footage is kept in the cloud.</p>
