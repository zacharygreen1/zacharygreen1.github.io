<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning several decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet economical systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and watch it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective transgressors are less likely to devote criminal activity if they think they are being viewed or have a greater risk of being nabbed. This is likewise referred to as the reasonable option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance technique, which argues that opportunities to anger can be decreased by modifying a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a wrongdoer being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, reducing rewards from criminal offense commission, and minimizing justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the culprit should know the included surveillance for it to attain its desired effect.</p>
