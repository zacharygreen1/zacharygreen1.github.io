<p>Ring may not be the most sophisticated system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has actually gotten quite the excitement throughout the years. We have actually been evaluating Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we actually like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security set that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring charges.

While it's more expensive than many other cameras, the total quality of the Arlo Pro 3 helps comprise the difference in rate.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

We agree with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit restricted to advise as a top choice.</p>
