<p>Various types of CCTV cameras. While alarm system technology has developed substantially since the 19th century, it is still based upon the basic principles innovated by Augustus Pope and Alexander Bell. All major alarm companies, including Mijac Alarm, use distance sensing units in the windows and doors as the first line of defense against potential burglars, and alarm systems transmit information to a main monitoring station that can dispatch law enforcement rapidly and successfully.</p>
<p>Alarm monitoring is part of a total home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (typically very high decibel so that you can hear it as can neighbors in some cases) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company.

Then, the monitoring company right away sets to action, connecting with you and informing the authorities.</p>

As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients understand that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
