<p>3 huge advantages of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, portability and expandability. Tenants, unlike house owners, generally prevent making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits.
