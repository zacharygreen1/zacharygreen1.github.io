<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
