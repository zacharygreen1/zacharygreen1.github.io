The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of free cloud storage (with more readily available for a monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to properly find motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That likewise saves battery life, however it might leave you with taping gaps during essential security events.
