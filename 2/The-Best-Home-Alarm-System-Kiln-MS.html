<p>Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misunderstanding is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the internet. Finally, wire-free cameras are completely cable free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are necessary, these are the simplest alternative to install and all of the tape-recorded video is saved in the cloud.</p>
