<p>Amongst IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless suggests the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then links to the web and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are completely cable television totally free and battery powered.
