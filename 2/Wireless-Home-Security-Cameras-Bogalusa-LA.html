<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
