<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
