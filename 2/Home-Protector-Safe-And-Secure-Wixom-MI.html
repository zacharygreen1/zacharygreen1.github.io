<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
