<p>Ring Alarm is super budget-friendly and has good clever home support. But do not anticipate very trendy equipment. Throughout our indoor testing, we sent out the Circle 2 to Costs McKinley, executive director of Details Security at The New York City Times (parent company of Wirecutter), for hack testing. There are no unencrypted connections, no odd IPs it's connecting to, and the app looked solid with no vulnerabilities noticed," he stated.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
