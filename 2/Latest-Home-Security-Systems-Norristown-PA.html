Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices because their style permits minimum glare.

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
