IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
