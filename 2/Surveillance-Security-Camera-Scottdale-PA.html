<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

Consider that some companies lock you into their service for a year or more. Breaking the agreement could cost you numerous dollars. The Arlo Pro is the company's very first wireless home security camera, and though it's been eclipsed in features and resolutions by more recent designs, the original still holds up well. It's a simple to use camera with a bunch of customizable controls. It operates on a rechargeable battery, and has a weatherproof case that protects it from the components.</p>

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
