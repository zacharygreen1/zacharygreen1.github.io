<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were often missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline.
