If you wish to watch on what's occurring in your house when you're not there, however you don't wish to buy a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera is worth a look.

<p>Some wireless security companies have extra features and prepare for an added cost. If you  wish to have continuous video recording and cloud storage for your security cameras, you'll need to pay a yearly or regular monthly cost.
