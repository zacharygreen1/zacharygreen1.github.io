<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was created for homeowners. It needs to be installed by an expert alarm installation team and, when installed, is hard to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more common for big homes and are frequently more costly than a wireless home security system.

In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to revamp the existing wires in your house.
