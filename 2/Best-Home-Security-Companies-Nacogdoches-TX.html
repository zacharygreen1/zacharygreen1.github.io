<p>Thanks to recent improvements in innovation, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've made the decision to install a burglar alarm, you must consider the following benefits of wireless technology.

For $15 monthly, you can include around-the-clock expert monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive strategy includes control through iOS and Android smartphone apps, push and email informs, and 30-day event-footage storage for unlimited cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is readily available independently.
