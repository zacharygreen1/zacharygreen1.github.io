<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
