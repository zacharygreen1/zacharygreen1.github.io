The $25-per-month Interactive plan adds control through iOS and Android smartphone apps, push and e-mail informs, and 30-day event-footage storage for unrestricted cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is available individually.

Nevertheless, an exception can be made for home security systems that feature advantages like the ADT Mover's Cost savings Plan, which allow you to take your equipment to a new home. This also depends on the provider, but you can expect signing a contract with providers who need professional installation of their systems. The average length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the higher end, some agreements could span approximately 60 months or 5 years.
