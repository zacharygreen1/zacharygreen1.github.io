The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of free cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly cost ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to appropriately spot motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That likewise conserves battery life, but it may leave you with tape-recording gaps during important security occasions.
