<p>You'll require a camera with onboard video storage or cloud recording capabilities if you desire to playback your home's outdoor activity.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
