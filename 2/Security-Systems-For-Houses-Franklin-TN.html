<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the whole household will love. ADT is a household name, so we frequently try out their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task. In our latest round of screening, we realized that ADT is the most popular provider for a factor. We believe their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty hectic with cool clever home functions. We especially liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>

<h2>The Best Smart Home Security Systems For 2020 Franklin</h2>
<p>Although it has a lot of versatility in placement, the Nest Webcam Outdoor does require a source of power, so it should be put within reach of an outlet. This can be a problem outside your house.

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
