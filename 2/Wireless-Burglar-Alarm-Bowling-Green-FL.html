<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
