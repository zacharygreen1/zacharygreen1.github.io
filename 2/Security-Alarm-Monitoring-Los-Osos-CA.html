<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound modifications to the character of our public spaces. When citizens are being seen by the authorities - or conscious they might be seen at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "understanding that you are being seen by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people may find out to be mindful about the periodicals and books they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts."

Fortunately, surveillance does not have to be hard. Keep checking out to see the equipment and parts you'll require to get your IP surveillance system up and running.</p>
