<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with a tempting chance for criminal abuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-ranking police official in Washington, DC was caught using cops databases to gather info on clients of a gay club. By looking up the license plate varieties of parking lot at the club and looking into the backgrounds of the automobiles' owners, he attempted to blackmail clients who were married. Picture what somebody like that might do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>

A keypad can sit by the front door, making it simple to arm and deactivate the system. If you already own a Ring video doorbell and want to broaden your home security coverage, adding Ring Alarm makes good sense.
