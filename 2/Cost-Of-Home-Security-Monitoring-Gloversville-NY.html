<h3>Highest Rated Home Security Systems in New York</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
