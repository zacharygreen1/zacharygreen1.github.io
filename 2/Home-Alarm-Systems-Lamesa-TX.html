<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
