Retail facilities utilize video surveillance to monitor consumer transactions. For example, if a client declares to have actually acquired a costly product but does not have the invoice, or that an employee was impolite or offered false information, video surveillance records can be used to figure out whether they remained in the shop on the day in question, and what, in reality, occurred.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
