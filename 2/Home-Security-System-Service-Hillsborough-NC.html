As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
