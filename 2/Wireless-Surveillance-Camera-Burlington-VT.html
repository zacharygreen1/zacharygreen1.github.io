<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their mobility, impermanence and expandability. Tenants, unlike property owners, usually prevent making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and setting up long-term electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other components can easily be set up at various homes later on, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new elements too. Wireless security plans also permit push-button control of the system and basic home automation.
