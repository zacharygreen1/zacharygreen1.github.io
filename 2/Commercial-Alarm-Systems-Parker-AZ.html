However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have crucial fobs and extra sensors, too.</p>
