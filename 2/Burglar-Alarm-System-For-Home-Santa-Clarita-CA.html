<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise great metal building.

Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
