We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and just informs you when motion is developed by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect alerts). Nevertheless, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have been activated.
