Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I tested, including clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. However the Secure is pricey, extra sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include fire alarms or camera backups-- is also pricey if you do not commit to a three-year contract.</p>
