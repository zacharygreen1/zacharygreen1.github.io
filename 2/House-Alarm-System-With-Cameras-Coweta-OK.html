<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the entire household will love. ADT is a household name, so we often check out their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our latest round of screening, we recognized that ADT is the most popular provider for a factor.

<p>The majority of the cameras we tested require an Air Conditioning outlet, so placement is absolutely an aspect. A few models use batteries, making placement more flexible, but this requires other compromises, which we highlight in the Competition section. Wi-Fi coverage also impacts where you place a camera: If you want to put a camera in a spot that doesn't get a good Wi-Fi signal, think about upgrading your router or including an extender or repeater. (For a look at our networking choices, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for Most People)" and The Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good rule of thumb that if your mobile phone or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the area you want to install the camera, you likely won't have a problem.</p>

Both the original Abode system and the Abode Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only model we evaluated that also deals with HomeKit. We've come across a couple of technical concerns while long-term testing the House Iota, and so will continue to test and upgrade accordingly. We no longer advise it.</p>
