<p>Think about it in this manner, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced video camera be sold for the low cost of forty dollars? It just does not accumulate. To use such low prices, manufacturers should cut corners, and completion outcome is jeopardized efficiency.

<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you stroll by.
