IP cameras are the more modern version of analog cameras, and while the specific cameras tend to be a little more pricey, they use a number of functions that analog cameras do not. Here's a look at the distinctions in between the two types of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more steady than they used to be. However, they are still subject to interference and they are still vulnerable to being hacked even if the signal is encrypted.</p>
